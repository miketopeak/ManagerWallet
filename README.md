# LETH (alfa release)
The First mobile LigthWallet for Ξthereum

# About
LΞTH (Ligth Ξthereum Mobile Wallet) is the first hybrid mobile app to manage an Ethereum wallet built using Ionic framework.

# Features
Thanks to the great job in library of ConsenSys (eth-lightwallet), the app could manage the key-pairs securely on smartphone side without send any password out of the wallet.

With LETH you could:

- Create a ligthwallet 
- Add an Ethereum wallet address
- Set an Ethereum node address private/public
- Send ETH
- Receive ETH
- List your transaction
- Earn Wei on your wallet just watching some banner (*new)
- ... more to be defined
